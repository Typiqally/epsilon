# Epsilon

Epsilon is an application for students from Fontys HBO-ICT education that are following open innovation.
These students usually have a personal course within Canvas (from Instructure), which contains all of their study submissions and acts as a portfolio of sorts.
During each semester, it is requested to take note of all KPI's which have been proven.
To aid in these efforts, this application will gather all your mastered/proven [KPI's](https://hbo-i.nl/domeinbeschrijving/) and export your KPI's to a file format (e.g., JSON, Exel, CSV).
